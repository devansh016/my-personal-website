Hi!

I'm Devansh, I solve problems in creative ways. 

I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects. I am a young and energetic professional, looking for challenging opportunities to grow my skills.

My intellectual curiosity also drives me to be a lifelong learner, and so I'm seeking to connect with like-minded people to learn and grow more. And in the way won't mind working under someone to know how everything works. And as far as my specialties?

My specialties:
+ Backend Development
+ Analytical thinking
+ Web Development

I enjoy traveling around the world and talking about space and quantum computing, so if you ever want to bounce ideas off of me, please feel free to contact me.

Connect to know more :)
